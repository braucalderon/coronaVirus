# CovidConnect
 
### `Objective`
<ul>
 <li>Data easy to understand without overwhelming the user.</li>
<li>Automatic updates from the API server.</li>
<li>Easy to access and navigate from a desktop to a mobile device.</li>
</ul>

### `Implementation`
<ul>
    <li>Class components</li>
   <li>Chart JS</li>
   <li>JSON format</li>
    <li>Material UI</li>
    <li>Props history</li>
    
</ul>
 

### `Challenges`
<ul>
    <li>As I get more familiar with components in react and the manipulation of APIs. I wanted to develop a website using real data. The struggles from fetching too much data to fetch the necessary data have been taking more of the time as I wanted to keep a good performance.</li>
    <li>The application updates data two days back from the current day because of the way data is updated in the server.</li>
    <li>The automatic update has been the most challenging taks for this project, as it breaks down at the end of each month.</li>
    <li>The component architecture was another learned lesson for this project.</li>
 </u>


### `Files`
<lu>
    <li>The architecture of the States.jsx and Statistics.jsx are not executed with the precision to be efficient components.</li>
