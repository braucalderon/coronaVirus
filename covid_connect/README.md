### `Challenges`
<ul>
    <li>As I get more familiar with components in react and the manipulation of API's. I wanted to develop a website using real data. The struggles from fetching too much data to fetch the necessary data have been taking more of the time as I wanted to keep performance to the max, even in mobiles.</li>
    <li>The application updates data two days back from the current day, because of the way data is updated in the server.</li>
    <li>New Year's issue: the system stopped updating data after December 31st. However, the issue was fixed by pinpoint the piece of code that was broken and testing different scenarios.</li>
    <li>The code was created with error messages that direct me straight to the source of the problem, in other words to the component that was having the issue.</li>

</ul>
 
 ### `Note`
 <ul>
    <li>The website is fully optomized for mobiles.</li>
</ul>
